This is a swiftly done sudoku solver for the F29AI Coursework (2025-2026). It has not yet been tested fully, so there could be some issues remaining (mainly about loading up csv files with multiple lines, to be fair). 

There should be explications about the choices in the report associated with this work, but feel free to send an email to to4008@hw.ac.uk if any questions remain.

In this code are included two main files, the GUI.py file that creates and loads everything into the GUI, and the main.py file where the backtracking function is situated.

Two examples are also included, for quick testing. 

To all our fellow students who might be inspired by the code, please don't, as it would only penalyze both our groups, which, honestly, isn't quite nice.

Have a lovely day,
